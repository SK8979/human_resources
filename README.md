# human_resources
This is an analysis of human resources data.
The analysis was performed from June 15, 2020 to July 20, 2020, using data downloaded on June 15, 2020.

RATIONALE:
The purpose of the analysis was to determine if there were any differences in monthly income between Sales Department employees with and without attrition, based on human resources (HR) data.

INSIGHTS:
The distribution of monthly income does not appear to significantly differ between salespeople (Sales Department employees) with and without attrition. At best, it is possible to say that there is a higher (possibly non-significant) number of salespeople without attrition with higher income levels (i.e., $15,000 and above). Note that there are more salespeople without attrition than salespeople with attrition.
